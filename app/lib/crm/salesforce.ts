// Salesforce — Web-to-Lead.
//
// WHY WEB-TO-LEAD AND NOT A CONNECTED APP: it is a form-encoded POST to a public
// endpoint with an org id and a set of field ids. No OAuth, no connected app, no
// security review, nothing to procure — the customer copies their org id out of
// Setup and pastes it in. Locked decision 19. Connected-app client-credentials
// is a later upgrade for customers who need confirmed writes; it is not v1.
//
// ============================================================================
// WEB-TO-LEAD RETURNS NO CONFIRMATION. READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" ANYTHING.
// ============================================================================
// The endpoint answers 200 with an HTML page (or a redirect to `retURL`) for a
// valid submission, an invalid one, a wrong org id and a field id that does not
// exist. THERE IS NO RESPONSE BODY TO PARSE — no lead id, no error list, no
// JSON. Salesforce queues the submission and, if it cannot be processed, emails
// the org's Web-to-Lead contact. That is the whole feedback channel.
//
// So: a 2xx marks the delivery DELIVERED, and DELIVERED here means ACCEPTED, not
// CREATED. The settings UI says exactly that, in those words, and must keep
// saying it. Do not "improve" this module by parsing the response — there is
// nothing in it. Do not treat the HTML as an error signal — it is the same HTML
// on success. If confirmed writes are needed, that is the connected-app upgrade,
// not a change to this file.
//
// FIELD IDS. Standard Lead fields use documented names (`first_name`,
// `last_name`, `email`, `company`, `lead_source`, `description`). Custom fields
// use the 15-character id Salesforce shows in the Web-to-Lead HTML generator
// (`00N…`). UNKNOWN FIELDS ARE SILENTLY DROPPED — Salesforce does not complain
// about a field id it does not recognise. That is why company size defaults into
// `description` rather than a guessed standard field: a guess that is wrong
// loses the data with no error anywhere.
