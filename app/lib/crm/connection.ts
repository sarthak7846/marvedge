// Validating and resolving a CrmConnection.
//
// Two jobs, both of which have to happen before anything is stored or sent:
//   1. VALIDATE what the owner typed, per provider, with zod — same shape as the
//      CTA routes' schemas (app/api/demos/[id]/ctas/route.ts).
//   2. RESOLVE a stored row into a ResolvedConnection with its credentials
//      decrypted, or nothing at all.
//
// The webhook URL is the one field here that is an SSRF surface: we POST to
// whatever the owner types. It is restricted to https and to a public host, so a
// connection cannot be pointed at `http://169.254.169.254/…` or at something
// inside the deployment's own network. That check runs on SAVE, so a rejected
// URL is a form error the owner can see, not a silent delivery failure later.
