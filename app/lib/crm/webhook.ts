// The generic signed webhook — the escape hatch.
//
// BUILT FIRST, deliberately. A customer on neither HubSpot nor Salesforce still
// gets their leads, and this is the one provider that can be verified end to end
// without anybody's sandbox: point it at a local server, check the signature,
// done. If the rest of this directory is broken, this path proves whether the
// problem is in delivery or in a provider adapter.
//
// The body is a stable JSON envelope. Fields may be ADDED to it; renaming or
// removing one breaks every receiver, so treat it as a public contract — the
// same reason /api/v3 exists at all.
//
// SIGNING IS IN ./signature.ts, with the scheme written out there and in
// ./README.md. What matters here: the signature covers THE EXACT BYTES POSTED,
// so `body` is serialised once and both signed and sent, never re-serialised.
