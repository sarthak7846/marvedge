 * still open. Deepgram covers Arabic (see the table below), so we can now
 * *produce* Arabic cues — but producing them is useless if they come out
 * reversed, disconnected or as boxes in the burned-in video, and that has not
 * been checked on a real render.
 *
 * Two things would have to hold, and neither was testable while writing PR 5
 * (no ffmpeg locally, no container, no sample audio):
 *   1. the preview must lay the text out RTL — `toCssStyle` sets `direction`
 *      from this, which is ordinary CSS and the low-risk half; and
 *   2. libass (ffmpeg's `subtitles` filter) must reorder the bidirectional text
 *      and shape the Arabic glyphs. libass does this through FriBidi and
 *      HarfBuzz, but only when it was BUILT with them, and the container's
 *      ffmpeg build has not been inspected. A build without them renders Arabic
 *      as isolated, left-to-right letterforms — legible-looking in a log,
 *      wrong on screen.
 *
 * So the whole RTL path is implemented and wired, and switched OFF here.
 * `isSttOffered` and `isTranslationTarget` both consult this, so no RTL language
 * reaches either picker until someone flips this after checking a real 1080p
 * export with real Arabic text. Shipping a language that silently renders
 * garbage is worse than not offering it — the same rule that keeps a language
 * with no STT coverage out of the picker.

/**
 * The seven PRD languages, in picker order (English first, then the rest by

 *
 * ABOUT `stt` AND `sttModel`
 * --------------------------
 * `documented` means Deepgram's model matrix lists the language for the model in
 * `sttModel`. It does **not** mean anyone has pushed real audio through the
 * pipeline and read the cues back — see the note on `SttCoverage` in ./types.
 *
 * PR 5 checked all seven against Deepgram's current matrix. Six are on `nova-2`,
 * which is what the worker has always sent, so nothing about their requests
 * changes. Arabic is the exception and the reason `sttModel` exists at all:
 *
 *   **nova-2 does not support Arabic.** It is absent from nova-2's language
 *   list. Arabic is covered by **nova-3**, which added it as its first
 *   right-to-left language across 17 regional variants (`ar`, `ar-EG`, `ar-SA`,
 *   …). This resolves the TODO PR 1 left here.
 *
 * Of the two options the PR offered — route the language to a different Deepgram
 * model, or fall back to OpenAI Whisper — routing to nova-3 was chosen: it is
 * the same vendor, the same endpoint, the same auth and the same response shape,
 * so it costs one parameter in the worker instead of a second transcription
 * pipeline with its own cue-clustering. Whisper would have meant re-implementing
 * `cuesFromDeepgramWords` against a different word-timing format.
 *
 * Arabic still does not appear in any picker, because `RTL_RENDERING_VERIFIED`
 * is false. That gate is about RENDERING, not coverage.
