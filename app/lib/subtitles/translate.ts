// Subtitle translation: the pure half (PRD §6.7 / US-4).
//
// Everything here is provider-agnostic and side-effect free — no OpenAI import,
// no env, no network. The route (app/api/subtitles/translate/route.ts) owns the
// API call and the key; this module owns the two things that decide whether a
// translated track is correct rather than merely present:
//
//   1. TIMINGS ARE NEVER TRANSLATED. `applyTranslations` copies `start` and
//      `end` across verbatim and replaces `text` only. The model is never shown
//      a timestamp, never asked to re-time anything, and its output is never
//      consulted about ordering.
//   2. ALIGNMENT IS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED. `parseTranslationBatch` requires the
//      response to carry exactly the indices it was given — no more, no fewer,
//      no duplicates — and THROWS otherwise.
//
// Rule 2 is a deliberate departure from app/api/avs/script/route.ts, which
// silently falls back to the original text when the model drops a segment. That
// is right for a tone rewrite: the worst case is an un-rewritten line. It is
// wrong here. If cue 40 goes missing and everything after it shifts up by one,
// every remaining subtitle is shown against the wrong audio for the rest of the
// video — a demo that is worse than having no translation at all, and worse
// still because it looks fine until someone watches to the end. Failing loudly
// turns a silent, invisible corruption into a visible, retryable error.
