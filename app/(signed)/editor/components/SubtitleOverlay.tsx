/**
 * The live subtitle preview (SUB PR 4 / US-3, PRD §6.5).
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
 * --------------------
 * This used to hardcode its own appearance — a 16px white line in a `bg-black/70`
 * box, pinned 24px above the bottom. The export hardcoded a DIFFERENT one: an
 * ASS style with a height-proportional font and an outline, and no box at all.
 * The preview was showing something the render never produced.
 *
 * Both ends now read app/lib/subtitles/style.ts, so "styling changes are
 * reflected in the preview" is structural rather than something two files have
 * to be kept in sync by hand. The visible consequence on an unstyled demo is
 * that the black box disappears and the text gains an outline — the preview
 * moving to match the export, not the export changing. Nothing about the
 * exported file differs.
 *
 * SIZING
 * ------
 * A subtitle's size is a percentage of FRAME height, so px only make sense
 * against a specific frame. The stage is measured, the export frame height is
 * derived from its aspect ratio (`exportFrameHeight`, which mirrors the worker's
 * `computeTargetSizeForRatio`), metrics are resolved at THAT height, and the
 * result is scaled down by `stageHeight / frameHeight`. The preview is therefore
 * a true miniature of the export — including the font clamp, which binds on a
 * tall portrait frame and would otherwise show text 60% too large.
