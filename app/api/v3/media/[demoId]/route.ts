// GET /api/v3/media/[demoId] — the signed media URL for a gated demo.
//
// PUBLIC AND UNAUTHENTICATED, like the rest of /api/v3: it is called by the
// player on a page that may be served from a customer's own domain.
// middleware.ts rewrites a non-apex host to /hub/<domainKey>/… but skips
// everything under /api, so a player on demos.acme.com fetches this same-origin
// and lands here with the same mv_sid cookie scope.
//
// ============================================================================
// THIS IS THE ENFORCEMENT THE HARD GATE HAS BEEN MISSING
// ============================================================================
// PR 3 shipped the hard gate honestly: the media URL was in the page source and
// the object was publicly readable, so the gate held the UI and nothing else.
// With OVERLAYS_SIGNED_MEDIA_ENABLED on, a hard-gated demo's share page renders
// NO media URL at all and the player has to ask here — and here answers 403
// until a Lead row exists for the caller's mv_sid.
//
// WHAT IT STILL IS NOT. mv_sid is forgeable (it is a non-httpOnly analytics
// cookie and nothing may authorise on it — see app/lib/overlays/session.ts), but
// forging it does not help: the check is for a Lead ROW keyed on that id, and
// producing one means actually submitting the form. What a determined viewer
// still gets is a real URL, valid for the TTL, which they can pass on. This is a
// gate on "watched without giving us anything", not DRM, and PR 8's description
// says so.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS SIGNS THE MP4 AND NOT THE PLAYLIST
// ============================================================================
// A presigned URL signs ONE object. An HLS master playlist references variant
// playlists which reference segments, all by relative URI, and none of those
// references carry a signature — so a signed playlist on a private bucket plays
// exactly nothing. Making it work means rewriting every playlist per request
// with presigned segment URLs, which is a media proxy, not a presigner, and is
// out of scope here (as are DRM and per-segment encryption). So a hard-gated
// demo with signed media on is served its progressive MP4, signed. It loses
// adaptive bitrate and keeps its gate; the alternative loses the gate.
