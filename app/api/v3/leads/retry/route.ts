// POST /api/v3/leads/retry — redrive FAILED CRM deliveries.
//
// This is the redrive half of "no queue" (locked decision 10): a LeadDelivery
// row is the queue, and this endpoint is what drains the failures. A CRM that
// was down for an hour leaves FAILED rows with a readable `lastError`; one call
// here puts them through.
//
// ============================================================================
// OWNER-SCOPED, DESPITE THE /api/v3 PREFIX
// ============================================================================
// /api/v3 is otherwise the PUBLIC, unauthenticated, viewer-facing namespace
// (decision 2). This route sits there because #302 names the path, and it is the
// ONE endpoint under that prefix that requires a session — so the guard is
// stated loudly rather than assumed from the neighbourhood. Nothing here is
// reachable without an authenticated PRO/ENTERPRISE session, and the sweep is
// filtered to the caller's own connections.
//
// IDEMPOTENT. Only FAILED rows are selected and a DELIVERED row is terminal
// (app/lib/crm/state.ts), so calling this twice — a double-click, an overlapping
// cron — cannot deliver the same lead to the same CRM twice.
//
// NO SCHEDULER IN THIS PR, deliberately. This is a button and an endpoint; what
// calls it on a timer is a separate decision, and a cron that authenticates as a
// service rather than as a user needs a credential model this repo does not have
// yet.
