// POST /api/v3/leads — public, unauthenticated lead capture from the player.
//
// Same namespace reasoning as /api/v3/events: viewer-facing, no session, called
// from a page that may be served on a customer's own domain. middleware.ts
// rewrites a non-apex host to /hub/<domainKey>/… but skips everything under
// /api, so a gate on demos.acme.com posts same-origin here and lands on this
// handler in the same deployment, with the same mv_sid cookie scope.
//
// ============================================================================
// PII: THE ONE RULE
// ============================================================================
// `name`, `email` and `companySize` belong to someone who is not our user.
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE MAY LOG, ECHO OR THROW ANY OF THEM — not on success, not
// in an error, not in a message attached to an Error. Every log line below is a
// literal plus, at most, a demo id and an error CODE. That includes not logging
// `error.message` from Prisma: a validation error can quote the arguments it was
// given, and those arguments are the lead. app/api/views/route.ts sets this
// precedent; this holds it.
//
// The response is `{ ok: true }` and nothing else. The lead is never echoed
// back, so a caller cannot use this endpoint to read what is already stored.
//
// ============================================================================
// HOW HARD THIS ENDPOINT IS
// ============================================================================
// Rate limiting is MUCH tighter than /api/v3/events (5/min vs 120/min per
// IP+demo): a telemetry flush is not a user action, a lead submission is, and a
// lead table is a spam target in a way an events table is not. The honeypot and
// the minimum time-on-form are cheap bot filters and are documented as such in
// app/lib/overlays/lead.ts — they stop scripted form-fillers, not a person who
// reads the page.
//
// A bot signal (honeypot tripped, implausibly fast) answers 200 { ok: true }
// WITHOUT storing anything, deliberately: telling a script it was detected is
// how it learns to stop tripping the detector. A genuine validation failure does
// answer 400, because the human on the other end needs to know what to fix.
