// POST /api/crm/connections/[id]/test — send a synthetic lead through the REAL
// delivery path and report the REAL error.
//
// THE POINT IS THAT IT IS THE REAL PATH. A "test" that validates the shape of a
// token and reports success teaches the owner nothing: the failures that matter
// are a token without the right scope, an org id from the wrong sandbox, a
// webhook receiver that 500s. So this calls deliver() with the same resolved
// connection, the same normalizeLead() output and the same error classification
// that a live lead would take, and hands back whatever came out.
//
// WHAT IS SYNTHETIC: the contact. It is an obviously fake record with a
// documented address on a reserved domain, so a test lands in the CRM as
// something a human can recognise and delete rather than as a plausible
// prospect. NO REAL LEAD IS EVER USED — a test button that forwards a real
// person's details to a CRM the owner is still setting up would be a disclosure,
// not a diagnostic.
//
// WHAT IS NOT SYNTHETIC: the credentials, the network call, and the error.
//
// No LeadDelivery row is written. There is no Lead behind this, and inventing
// one would put a fake record in the owner's lead ledger.
