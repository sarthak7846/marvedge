// Owner-facing CRM connection management.
//
// Per-USER, not per-demo, so it sits at /api/crm/... alongside /api/hub rather
// than under /api/demos/[id]/... . "Workspace" in #302 means the User who owns
// the Demo (locked decision 3); if a real Workspace model ever lands, the only
// thing that moves is `userId` on the row.
//
// SHAPE COPIED FROM app/api/demos/[id]/ctas/route.ts: a session check, a zod
// schema, and writes scoped so that not-found and not-owned collapse into one
// 404. See ./[id]/route.ts for the updateMany form of that.
//
// ============================================================================
// NO ROUTE IN THIS DIRECTORY EVER RETURNS A CREDENTIAL
// ============================================================================
// GET returns MaskedConnection (app/lib/crm/mask.ts) — a provider, a hint, and
// the last outcome. A token that has been stored is write-only from then on: to
// change it you send a new one. There is no "reveal" endpoint and there must not
// be one, because a session-hijack that can read every customer's CRM token is a
// much worse outcome than an owner having to paste a token twice.
