/**
 * POST /api/subtitles/cancel — stop waiting on a subtitle job (PRD §13).
 *
 * WHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * It marks the VideoJob CANCELLED. That is the whole mechanism, and it is worth
 * being precise about, because "cancel" implies more than happens:
 *
 *   - The Cloud Run call ALREADY IN FLIGHT IS NOT ABORTED. `/subtitles` is one
 *     long opaque HTTP request with no cancellation channel; the worker
 *     downloads, extracts and transcribes to completion either way, and the
 *     Deepgram minutes are spent either way.
 *   - What cancelling buys is that the RESULT IS DISCARDED. The dispatcher in
 *     /api/subtitles/create re-reads the status before it writes anything, so
 *     cues from a cancelled run never land on the demo, never overwrite a track
 *     the user is happy with, and never flip the job to COMPLETED.
 *   - The client stops polling immediately, so the editor is usable again at
 *     once rather than at the end of the transcription.
 *
 * The UI copy says the same thing ("we'll discard the result") rather than
 * implying the work stops. Do not "improve" it into a promise this cannot keep.
 *
 * Cancelling is idempotent, and a job that has already finished is left alone:
 * there is nothing to discard once the cues are written, and rewriting a
 * COMPLETED job as CANCELLED would strip cues the user can already see.
