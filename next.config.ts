/**
 * THE APP'S FIRST CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT GLOBAL.
 *
 * It applies to the public viewer routes ONLY. /video-editor and the signed-in
 * app run ffmpeg.wasm, inline workers and blob: script URLs, and a blanket policy
 * would break them on the first load — so this one is scoped to the two path
 * families below and nothing else in this file's `headers()` widens it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR: bounding what a share page may FRAME and LOAD, now that it
 * frames a third party's document at all. `frame-src` is the point of the
 * exercise — it is the third and last enforcement point on the scheduling
 * allow-list, after the PUT sanitiser and the render-time check, and it is the
 * only one a browser enforces on our behalf.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: XSS protection. `script-src` carries 'unsafe-inline' because
 * Next's App Router inlines its bootstrap and flight-data scripts, and removing
 * it needs a per-request nonce threaded through middleware — a bigger change
 * than this PR, and one that would apply to far more than the share page. Saying
 * so here rather than letting a future reader infer a guarantee that is not
 * there.
 *
 * `frame-ancestors` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Customers embed share links in their
 * own pages today, and there is no allow-list of their domains anywhere in this
 * app; adding a restrictive one here would silently break existing embeds. That
 * is a separate decision with its own migration, not a free extra.
 *
 * IT IS NOT BEHIND OVERLAYS_ENABLED, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE — this was tried and
 * reverted. Next evaluates `headers()` at BUILD time and bakes the result into
 * routes-manifest.json; it is not re-read when the server boots. So a flag-gated
 * CSP is really a BUILD-time gate, and flipping OVERLAYS_ENABLED in a deployment
 * environment without a rebuild would turn the scheduling iframe on while leaving
 * the policy that bounds it silently absent. A header that is missing exactly
 * when it is needed is worse than one that is present a release early.
 *
 * Applying it unconditionally is safe in the other direction: every directive
 * below was checked against what the share page loads TODAY — next/font (self),
 * the QR's data:/blob: images, R2 media over https, the next-auth session fetch —
 * so a flag-off page behaves exactly as it does now. It changes a response
 * header, never the rendered markup the backward-compatibility criterion is
 * about.
